The NFL has yet to tackle its coronavirus problem, with the New England Patriots again having to postpone a game and the Tennessee Titans again having to shut down their facilities as each team announced new positive tests.

Monday's game between the Patriots and the Denver Broncos is being rescheduled, the league said Sunday on Twitter. The faceoff will now take place next Sunday during Week 6, moving the Broncos' original Week 6 match against the Miami Dolphins to Week 11.

The game was postponed after a new coronavirus case was confirmed on the Patriots.

The team confirmed to NBC News on Sunday that it had a new positive test, and it asked all Tier 1 and Tier 2 employees to continue daily coronavirus testing and not to enter the team's facilities.

New England's facilities were closed earlier after three players — Cam Newton, Stephon Gilmore and Bill Murray — tested positive. The team's problems with the virus pushed its game last week against the Kansas City Chiefs back an additional day.

Sunday also brought a new setback for the Titans, who confirmed to NBC News that another staff member had tested positive.

"We have temporarily closed our facility and are in communication with the league on the next steps," the team said in a statement.

The Titans announced only Saturday that they had returned to their facility as the virus wreaked havoc on their lineup and forced a shutdown weeks ago.

The Titans' outbreak has risen to 24 positive cases among players and staff. The fate of the Titans' game against the Buffalo Bills on Tuesday, already rescheduled from Sunday, is now in doubt.

An earlier game scheduled between the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Titans in Nashville, Tennessee, was postponed until Oct. 25.
